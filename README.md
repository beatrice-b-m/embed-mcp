# embed-mcp

Ask useful questions about the Emory Breast Imaging Dataset (EMBED) through CLI or MCP before
turning tables into cohorts.

EMBED is a breast-imaging research dataset from Emory Healthcare containing
screening and diagnostic mammography images, image metadata, and structured
clinical information. The HITI Lab's
[public EMBED documentation](https://docs.hitilab.com/datasets/embed) introduces
the dataset, its organization, access requirements, and supporting resources.
This project does not distribute the dataset or replace its official
documentation and data-use terms.

EMBED contains rich imaging, assessment, procedure, and pathology data, but its
physical layout alone cannot tell you what a row means, whether two records can
be attributed to each other, or which date is appropriate for a study. This
project provides a reviewed, machine-queryable guide to those meanings.

Use it to answer questions such as:

- What does missing pathology mean?
- Which breast-cancer outcome states are represented?
- Can pathology be attributed to a particular imaging finding?
- Which timestamps are event dates and which are documentation dates?
- How does a clinical concept map to an EMBED V2 table and column?

The catalog works without access to EMBED data. It contains no clinical rows,
counts, distributions, or executable cohort definitions.

Catalog maintainers working in an authorized environment may use narrowly
scoped source-data inspection to resolve a specific representation question.
That authoring evidence is reconciled against applicable dictionaries, legends,
maintainer knowledge, and the
[public EMBED documentation](https://docs.hitilab.com/datasets/embed); source
rows and empirical summaries never become catalog content. See
[project scope](docs/project-scope.md#local-source-investigation) for the
boundary.

## Install

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Install
the lightweight catalog, Python API, and CLI directly from GitHub:

```bash
uv tool install \
  'embedv2-agent-context @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git'
```

Add only the optional interfaces you need:

```bash
# Read-only stdio MCP server.
uv tool install \
  'embedv2-agent-context[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git'

# Local catalog curation web viewer.
uv tool install \
  --with \
  'embedv2-agent-context-curator @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git#subdirectory=packages/curator' \
  'embedv2-agent-context @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git'

# Both optional interfaces.
uv tool install \
  --with \
  'embedv2-agent-context-curator @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git#subdirectory=packages/curator' \
  'embedv2-agent-context[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git'
```

These commands create an isolated environment and install commands into uv's
executable directory:

- `embed-context` queries the catalog from a terminal or script.
- `embed-context-mcp`, when the `mcp` extra is selected, lets an AI client
  query the same catalog over stdio MCP.

The `curator` extra installs the separate
`embedv2-agent-context-curator` companion distribution. The base wheel contains
neither its Python implementation nor its HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets.
The `curate` subcommand remains visible in base CLI help and reports the exact
extra needed when the companion is absent.

If uv says its executable directory is not on `PATH`, run:

```bash
uv tool update-shell
```

Then start a new shell and verify the installation:

```bash
embed-context --version
embed-context validate
```

For a reproducible Git installation, select the root project at a tag or
commit:

```bash
uv tool install \
  'embedv2-agent-context @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git@REV'
```

Add `[mcp]` after `embedv2-agent-context` when needed. A curator installation
must install both projects from the same revision:

```bash
uv tool install \
  --with \
  'embedv2-agent-context-curator @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git@REV#subdirectory=packages/curator' \
  'embedv2-agent-context @ git+https://github.com/beatrice-b-m/embed-mcp.git@REV'
```

Add the root package's `mcp` extra to the final argument when both optional
interfaces are needed. Keeping both URLs at the same revision preserves the
lockstep core/curator compatibility contract. To install from a local clone,
run `uv tool install '.[curator]'` in the repository root.
Contributors should instead use the workspace development environment described
in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Start with a clinical question

You do not need to know a table name or catalog identifier:

```bash
embed-context discover "What does absent pathology mean?" \
  --profile open-v2 --limit 5
```

Each match explains why it was returned and gives you a stable identifier.
Follow that identifier with the matching exact command:

```bash
embed-context guardrail guardrail.null-pathology-not-negative
```

The result explains that pathology which is not attached through the represented
field is not evidence of a negative diagnosis, benign disease, or complete
follow-up. It also links to related concepts and reviewed provenance.

Other useful starting points:

```bash
# Understand represented cancer outcomes and when they become known.
embed-context discover \
  "How is breast cancer represented and when is it known?" --limit 5

# Examine attribution between imaging findings and pathology.
embed-context discover \
  "pathology attribution to imaging findings" \
  --kind semantic_relationship --kind guardrail --limit 5

# Find candidate pathology timestamps.
embed-context discover \
  "Which timestamps could anchor pathology?" \
  --kind temporal_semantic --limit 5
```

Discovery can return clinical objects, features, relationships, time meanings,
aggregations, interpretation guardrails, coverage statements, and supporting
context. A no-result response means the catalog has no indexed answer under
the selected filters; it does not prove that a concept is absent from EMBED or
clinical reality.

## Move from meaning to implementation

Start with shared or selected-profile clinical semantics. Once you know which
concepts your work needs, inspect how the selected profile represents them:

```bash
embed-context feature pathology.severity --include-codes
embed-context object imaging_finding
embed-context profile-table open-v2 exam_level_anon
embed-context relationship-bindings \
  --profile open-v2 \
  --semantic-relationship clinical.finding-pathology-observation
```

Profile bindings describe tables, columns, physical associations, evidence,
and known join hazards. They are not executable joins and do not choose an
analysis policy for you.

Physical columns are inventoried independently from their semantic mappings.
This lets unmapped columns remain visible during curation, allows renamed or
derived columns to reuse a concept, and permits one occurrence to carry several
explicitly ambiguous or conditional mappings. Co-located objects are computed
from their shared table rather than declared as a special representation.

Run `embed-context --help` to see all commands. The main navigation pattern is:

```text
clinical question
  -> discover
  -> exact semantic record
  -> related records and provenance
  -> profile binding, if implementation detail is needed
```

## Use structured output

Put `--format json` before the subcommand for a stable response envelope:

```bash
embed-context --format json discover \
  "What does absent pathology mean?" --limit 5
```

Successful responses have `ok: true`, the command name, and a `data` object.
Errors use the same envelope with `ok: false`, a structured error type, and a
message. This makes the CLI suitable for scripts and agent tooling as well as
interactive use.

## Curate catalog modules locally

Maintainers who installed the `curator` extra can open the temporary local
metadata workbench without accessing EMBED data:

```bash
embed-context curate
```

The server binds only to `127.0.0.1`, opens an automatically allocated port,
and stops with the command. Review mode is read-only. To edit, explicitly name
one loaded filesystem-backed schema-v8 module:

```bash
embed-context \
  --extension-file project-configs/review.json \
  curate --edit-module project-configs/review.json
```

The companion workbench edits the authored module and validates it through the
same catalog resolver and domain checks as normal loading. It compares real
catalog discovery before and after the draft and displays the exact prospective
bytes before an atomic save. It never serializes the effective catalog, reads
clinical artifacts, runs git commands, or exposes a remote service. Use
`--no-open` for manual browser launch.

## Connect an AI client

The optional `embed-context-mcp` command exposes the catalog as thirteen
read-only MCP tools. The client starts the command itself and communicates over
standard input/output; you do not run the server in a separate terminal.

Installing the MCP extra does not select a dataset profile. Profile selection
happens when the server starts:

- with no composition arguments, the bundled default catalog set loads only
  `open-v2`;
- `internal-v2` must be loaded explicitly; and
- adding `--profile-file` without `--no-default-profiles` loads that profile
  alongside the default `open-v2` profile rather than replacing it.

The `profile` argument on individual MCP query tools filters contributions from
an already loaded profile. It does not load a profile that was omitted at
server startup.

Confirm that the command is visible in the environment where your client
starts:

```bash
command -v embed-context-mcp
embed-context-mcp --version
```

### Codex

Register the default `open-v2` server:

```bash
codex mcp add embed_context_open -- embed-context-mcp
codex mcp list
```

Equivalent configuration:

```toml
[mcp_servers.embed_context_open]
command = "embed-context-mcp"
```

The uv tool environment also contains the non-default `internal-v2` catalog
set. Resolve its installed absolute path once, validate it, and pass it to a
separately named Codex MCP server:

```bash
INTERNAL_CATALOG=$(find "$(uv tool dir)/embedv2-agent-context/lib" \
  -path '*/site-packages/embed_context/_data/internal-v2-catalog-set.json' \
  -print -quit)

embed-context --catalog "$INTERNAL_CATALOG" validate

codex mcp add embed_context_internal -- \
  embed-context-mcp --catalog "$INTERNAL_CATALOG"
codex mcp list
```

The validation output should report `profiles: internal-v2`. The environment
directory retains the distribution name `embedv2-agent-context`; that package
name is independent of the repository name. Re-resolve the path if the uv tool
is removed and reinstalled into a different tool directory.

Equivalent configuration, after replacing the placeholder with the absolute
path printed by `printf '%s\n' "$INTERNAL_CATALOG"`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.embed_context_internal]
command = "embed-context-mcp"
args = [
  "--catalog",
  "/absolute/path/to/internal-v2-catalog-set.json",
]
```

From a retained repository checkout, the source-tree manifest is an equivalent
and simpler stable path:

```bash
codex mcp add embed_context_internal -- \
  embed-context-mcp \
  --catalog /absolute/path/to/embed-mcp/catalog/internal-v2-catalog-set.json
```

You may register `embed_context_open` and `embed_context_internal` at the same
time. To replace an existing registration instead, remove or edit that MCP
server and add it again with the desired startup arguments.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user \
  embed-context -- embed-context-mcp
claude mcp list
```

### OpenCode

Add this local server to `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "embed_context": {
        "type": "local",
        "command": ["embed-context-mcp"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If a desktop client does not inherit your shell `PATH`, `uv tool dir --bin`
prints uv's executable directory. Use the absolute path to
`embed-context-mcp` in that client's configuration.

Agents should begin with the MCP `discover` tool, follow returned identifiers
with exact semantic getters, review the returned `constraints`, and inspect
profile bindings only when they need release-specific implementation detail.
For longitudinal pathology questions, candidate search follows the patient's
timeline; the candidate pathology accession is not forced to equal the index
exam accession.

## Use the Python API

The Python package exposes the same validated, composable catalog set:

```python
from embed_context import load_catalog

catalog = load_catalog()
matches = catalog.discover(
    "absent pathology",
    profile="open-v2",
    limit=5,
)
guardrail = catalog.get_guardrail(
    "guardrail.null-pathology-not-negative"
)
```

The no-argument loader selects the bundled portable semantic catalog and the
public `open-v2` profile, with no project extensions. External profile and
extension modules are explicit and are never searched for automatically:

```python
catalog = load_catalog(
    profile_paths=["catalog/profiles/internal-v2.json"],
    extension_paths=["project-configs/derived-features.json"],
    include_default_profiles=False,
)
```

The CLI and MCP entry points expose the same composition controls with
repeatable `--profile-file` and `--extension-file` options. Use
`--no-default-profiles` to omit manifest-selected profiles and
`--include-default-extensions` to opt into extensions selected by a custom
manifest. Feature and code lookup accept `--profile` when several loaded
profiles make vocabulary resolution ambiguous.

Query results retain contribution origins, so portable meaning, released
profile representation, and project-owned content remain distinguishable.
Profiles and extensions may contribute availability-scoped objects, concepts,
relationships, time semantics, aggregations, guardrails, and coverage rather
than waiting for every meaning to become portable. Qualifications add evidence
and caveats without mutating records; competing mappings remain separately
addressable and surface as alternatives or ambiguity.

Schema v8 is intentionally strict. Semantic schema 7, profile/extension schema
1, and schema-v6 monoliths are rejected at startup rather than silently
migrated. Update authored modules before loading them with software `0.10.0`.

The non-default `internal-v2` working profile now inventories the wide
`magview_all_cohorts_PACS_v2_anon` clinical table and binds distinct patient,
partial-episode, exam, breast-side, finding, interpretation, procedure,
putative specimen, and pathology objects alongside supported workflow meanings.
Within this profile, `empi_anon` supports longitudinal patient identity,
linked accessions are co-occurring exams in one imaging episode rather than
prior or follow-up exams, and `(acc_anon, numfind)` identifies one clinical
finding. A null finding side is bilateral and equivalent to `B`; either
representation projects to both unilateral breast-side identities. Finding
number `-9` is the synthetic contralateral BI-RADS 1/`N` finding added when a
bilateral exam has only a unilateral non-negative finding row. Every anonymized
date across EMBED tables and versions uses the same patient-specific shift;
`studydate_anon` and `procdate_anon` are exam and procedure occurrence times,
while `pdate_anon` remains provisional. Within a patient, each complete
`(procdate_anon, type, bside)` tuple identifies one procedure. Every exam-level
field is invariant within an accession; conflicts are data-quality errors.
Specimen-level presence, completeness, reliability, identity, and cardinality
remain unresolved and should not be relied upon. `path_severity` is the most
severe group selected by the extraction's fixed mapping over `path1` through
`path10`; a null severity with a populated descriptor or a represented value
`6` is a data-quality error, not a clinical category.
Unclear columns remain in the physical inventory without manufactured
mappings, and absent curated Open V2 aggregates are not projected onto the
internal table. Load `internal-v2` explicitly; it is not part of the public
default manifest.

Internal V2 also inventories `HormoneHist_anon`, `ProcedureHist_anon` (the
`ProcHist` surface), and `CancerHist_anon`. Reviewed topology packets supply
pandas parse types and observed grouping/code structure; maintainer confirmation
supplies the omitted free-text `comment` column on every table. All columns are
conservatively nullable, and no source text is included. HormoneHist and ProcHist
reuse the reviewed patient-history meanings and category-dependent bindings.
Their accession is recording context, not historical event time, and their
tested patient/exam groupings do not identify history entries.

CancerHist distinguishes patient history (`patient=1`) from relative history
(`patient=0`); `rel` is a relationship category, not a unique relative ID.
Cancer-code interpretations from the supplied draft dictionaries remain
provisional; BRCA codes, timing, and relative identity remain unresolved.
The review also records HormoneHist category/code discrepancies and ProcHist's
unresolved `FA,SF` composition. See the
[history packet review](docs/history-topology-review.md) for the evidence,
supported mappings, and remaining gaps.

The same profile also binds the image-metadata table, `metadata_all_cohorts_v1c`,
whose rows describe one extracted breast-imaging DICOM image instance each. It
carries the `image` object, co-located patient, exam, and image-derived
breast-side projections, DICOM-derived attributes, pipeline-derived
classifications, enrichment flags, and serialized per-image regions of
interest. Its physical types are assessed parse types rather than an embedded
schema, and every column is conservatively nullable. There is an important and
deliberate version boundary: the clinical surface is internal V2 while the
currently paired image metadata is the most recent internal **V1c** artifact,
which covers every EMBEDv1 exam and patient. It remains narrower than clinical
V2, so a clinical V2 exam with no matching image row
is therefore outside current extraction coverage and is **not** an exam without
images; an inner accession join silently discards those exams. `acc_anon`
and `empi_anon` use the same cross-table exam and patient namespaces. Each
accession belongs to exactly one patient; a cross-patient association is an
invalid data-quality error and must not be retained as a valid link. The
anonymized DICOM locator is intended to be present for every
extracted image. Its filename is the anonymized SOP Instance UID, providing
durable image identity within one dataset version; a missing path likely means
anonymization failed before the de-identified file could be saved. V1c covers
the DICOM objects associated with EMBEDv1 accessions after excluding secondary
captures and screen saves, except ROI_SS and ROI_SSC annotation images retained
solely for ROI extraction. Legacy PNG conversions and `has_pix_array` should
not be used for current work; use the anonymized DICOM files. DICOM Burned In Annotation records
whether the source declares sufficient burned-in annotation to identify the
patient and acquisition date; it is a declaration, not pixel-data verification,
and the catalogue prescribes no action from it.
Columns parsed directly from DICOM elements retain their standard DICOM
semantics; pipeline-derived fields require separate extraction evidence.
Regions of interest are serialized collections on the image row rather than one
row per region: the count, coordinate, frame-index, and depth-derivation
collections are generated in tandem and aligned by position. Coordinates are
inclusive `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]` bounds in the attached DICOM
pixel-array space: `[100, 200, 150, 250]` is 51×51 pixels and maps to
`image[100:151, 200:251]` in NumPy. Curated coordinates are expected within
the image bounds; residual out-of-bounds coordinates may be safely clipped.
The annotations originate from radiologists during routine clinical care
through multiple workflows, including direct coordinate extraction from
annotation DICOM objects without pixel arrays and annotation extraction from
ROI_SS/ROI_SSC screen captures. For some DBT ROIs an in-house model inferred
frame depth, marked by `ROI_depth_derived`. No stable ROI identifier or
cross-image correspondence is represented, and ROI-to-finding attribution is
reliable only when one finding exists on that accession side.

A uv tool installation is intentionally isolated and does not add
`embed_context` to unrelated Python environments. Add the package as a normal
dependency when importing it from another project.

## What the catalog will not decide

This project supplies context for designing an analysis; it does not design
the analysis itself. In particular, it does not:

- choose a cohort, diagnosis date, outcome window, exclusion rule, censoring
  rule, or aggregation policy;
- turn physical associations into guaranteed clinical attribution;
- treat imaging assessment as pathology truth;
- treat absent pathology as a negative outcome; or
- claim complete outcome capture or scientific validity.

One important example is time. EMBED represents imaging exam dates, procedure
dates, and pathology report dates with different meanings. The registered
profile does not supply a supported specimen-collection time, and no candidate
is designated as a universal diagnosis date. A missing selected endpoint stays
missing: procedure and report dates must not be coalesced or fallback-substituted
for one another. Separately named endpoints or sensitivity analyses can compare
their implications. Downstream pathology can also leak future information into
an earlier prediction target.

Risk outputs may support association or ranking questions while their scale,
horizon, model version, exceptional values, or probability meaning remains
unresolved. Probability calibration and Brier-score interpretation require
those semantics to be validated first.

See the [clinical-semantic model](docs/clinical-semantic-model.md) for the
outcome, attribution, time, aggregation, and uncertainty details that should
inform study design.

## Terms and version axes

- A **clinical object** is an independently meaningful entity or observation.
- A **feature** is shared or profile-available meaning owned by one or more
  clinical objects.
- A **semantic relationship** describes clinical adjacency or attribution.
- A **profile binding** describes how a physical release represents a meaning.
- A **physical column inventory** records a table's names, types, and schema
  nullability independently of semantic mappings.
- A **feature mapping** links one column occurrence to one concept with a
  `direct`, `derived`, `conditional`, `ambiguous`, or `unresolved` status.
- **Clinical instance identity** states how bound columns identify one
  represented object instance and where that identity stops.
- An **occurrence interpretation** qualifies the meaning of a value or null at
  one physical feature occurrence.
- A **binding path** composes ordered physical relationships that together
  implement one portable semantic relationship.
- A **guardrail** records a reusable interpretation constraint, not a policy.
- **Resolved constraints** summarize supported facts, unresolved claims,
  prohibited substitutions, required analyst choices, high-priority
  guardrails, and relevant contexts for an exact result.
- **Coverage** says what the catalog represents, not how complete the dataset
  is empirically.
