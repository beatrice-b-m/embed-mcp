# Catalog-set format

## Documents and versions

The current catalog is a deterministic composition of:

```text
catalog-set manifest (schema 1)
├── semantic catalog (schema 8)
├── zero or more profile modules (schema 2)
└── zero or more extension modules (schema 2)
```

The public manifest selects `catalog/semantic/catalog.json` and the `open-v2`
profile. `internal-v2` is bundled as a non-default working profile; its binding
covers the wide internal MagView clinical table, internal V1c
image metadata, and the hormone, procedure, and cancer history tables. All
schemas use JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 and close authored objects with
`additionalProperties: false`.

Schema v8 has no legacy input mode. A schema-v6 monolith, semantic schema 7,
profile schema 1, extension schema 1, wrong discriminator, or unknown version
causes a fatal startup error. The loader does not silently migrate or ignore
fields.

## Catalog-set manifest

The manifest names one semantic catalog plus default profile and extension
locators. Locators are closed unions:

```json
{"kind": "bundled", "resource": "semantic/catalog.json"}
```

```json
{"kind": "file", "path": "../shared/catalog.json"}
```

Bundled resources resolve through package data. File paths resolve relative to
the containing manifest. The resolver does not scan directories, expand
environment variables, or search the working directory or home directory.

## Semantic catalog

The semantic catalog contains controlled values and ID-keyed registries for
clinical objects, concepts, semantic relationships, temporal semantics,
aggregations, guardrails, coverage, vocabularies, sources, and contexts.

Objects define clinical instance meaning and descriptive grain independently
of storage. Concepts define reusable meaning and object ownership.
Relationships retain direction, cardinality, optionality, attribution limits,
and temporal qualification. Claims cite exact `context-id#claim-id` records.

The shared catalog includes the `image` object and `clinical.exam-image`
relationship. Their presence expresses shared meaning; it does not assert that
every profile supplies an image table, file layout, or verified physical key.
`internal-v2` supplies an image table whose `anon_dicom_path` basename is the
anonymized SOP Instance UID. That value supplies durable image identity within
one dataset version even though the UID is not exported as a separate metadata
column.

## Contributions and availability

Profiles and extensions have a closed `contributions` object with all semantic
families:

```json
{
  "clinical_objects": {},
  "concepts": {},
  "semantic_relationships": {},
  "temporal_semantics": {},
  "aggregations": {},
  "guardrails": {},
  "coverage": {}
}
```

Any module may introduce new meaning. Contributions do not need to exist in
the shared semantic catalog first. An optional availability record is either:

```json
{"scope": "portable"}
```

or:

```json
{"scope": "profiles", "profiles": ["internal-v2"]}
```

When omitted, semantic-catalog records default to portable availability and a
profile or extension contribution defaults to its target profile. Runtime
validation checks availability against loaded profiles and provenance scope.

The `internal-v2` profile demonstrates this mechanism in three independent ways.
Its MagView binding maps the wide `magview_all_cohorts_PACS_v2_anon` clinical
table to shared and profile-owned clinical semantics, including an internal
putative pathology-specimen object whose reliability and identity remain
unresolved. It also records longitudinal patient identity, same-episode linked
accessions, accession-plus-finding-number identity, date-shift and event-time
meaning, supported procedure representation, categorical normalization,
invalid pathology-severity value `6`, and a technical cancer-registry
reference.

Its patient-history contributions bind `HormoneHist_anon`, `ProcedureHist_anon`
(the `ProcHist` surface), and `CancerHist_anon`. Packet columns plus the confirmed
free-text `comment` field form complete inventories. `str` becomes `string` and
`int64` remains `int64`; comment is assessed as text from maintainer description,
and every column is conservatively nullable. These are parse assessments, not
source-declared schema constraints.

HormoneHist and ProcHist use category-specific mappings, patient ownership, and
imaging-accession recording context without unique history-entry identity.
Occurrence interpretations preserve unresolved category/code combinations and
the ProcHist composite result `FA,SF`; its vocabulary uses
`comma_composed_undocumented`. CancerHist maps the confirmed self/relative flag
and conditional relationship-category role. Its provisional type/cancercode
interpretations use `unresolved` mappings with category qualifiers and
`unverified` occurrence claims. BRCA and temporal fields remain inventoried
without clinical mappings. The existing schema supports this distinction;
neither parser behavior nor public response shapes change. See
[history packet review](history-topology-review.md).

Its image-metadata binding adds the `metadata_all_cohorts_v1c` table at
one row per extracted DICOM image instance. That table carries the `image`
object, the profile's `region_of_interest` object, co-located patient, exam, and
image-derived breast-side projections, a cross-table accession route for
`clinical.exam-image`, and a same-table route for
`clinical.image-region-of-interest`. Because the artifact is delimited text with
no embedded column schema, its recorded physical types are assessed parse types
and every column is conservatively nullable; unresolved and technical columns
stay inventoried without mappings. Region-of-interest information is a
serialized per-image collection, so no ROI row grain or ROI identifier is
declared; ROI coordinates use inclusive `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]` DICOM
pixel-array bounds. Curated coordinates are expected in bounds, residual
out-of-bounds values may be safely clipped, and radiologist provenance spans
multiple annotation workflows rather than only ROI_SS/ROI_SSC screen captures.
For DBT rows, the physical `ImagesInAcquisition` column maps to the
`internal-v2.image.dbt_frame_count` concept: it describes frames or z-slices
within the image, not distinct image instances in an acquisition group.
Cross-image ROI grouping remains absent. The paired image metadata is internal
V1c while the clinical surface is internal V2, so the
exam-to-image binding records incomplete coverage and states that an unmatched
clinical exam is not an exam without images. The accession remains one distinct
exam identifier in the shared cross-table namespace, belongs to exactly one
patient, and treats a cross-patient association as an invalid data-quality
error. The anonymized DICOM locator is intended for every
extracted image; its basename supplies dataset-version-scoped anonymized SOP
Instance UID identity. Observed missing values likely mean anonymization failed
before saving and keep the technical key physically incomplete. DICOM Burned
In Annotation uses the
standard `YES`, `NO`, and absent-attribute meanings and remains a source
declaration rather than pixel-data verification.

## Profile modules

A profile document has `profile_schema_version: 2`, one profile identity, a
requirement for semantic schema 8, semantic contributions, sources, contexts,
qualifications, vocabularies, and one physical `profile_binding`.

Vocabulary `parsing` distinguishes atomic values from fields that need
field-specific handling. `comma_delimited_unordered` means split the physical
value on commas and interpret the resulting component codes without assigning
meaning to their order or repetition. Unknown component meanings remain
unknown. `comma_composed_undocumented` is reserved for comma-bearing values
whose composition semantics have not been established.

### Physical table inventory

Tables declare physical columns independently of mappings:

```json
{
  "id": "open-v2.binding.table.patients_anon",
  "table": "patients_anon",
  "grain": "one exported patient row",
  "columns": [
    {"name": "empi_anon", "physical_type": "int64", "nullable": true}
  ],
  "keys": [],
  "caveats": []
}
```

`grain` is optional descriptive text, not a closed global enum. Physical type
and schema nullability occur once on the table-owned column. Columns may remain
unmapped while their semantics are unresolved. Keys, object identity, and
relationship endpoints must reference declared columns.

### Feature mappings

A feature binding maps one physical occurrence to one concept:

```json
{
  "id": "open-v2.binding.feature.patient-id",
  "table": "patients_anon",
  "column": "empi_anon",
  "concept": "identity.patient_identifier",
  "status": "direct"
}
```

Status is `direct`, `derived`, `conditional`, `ambiguous`, or `unresolved`.
Mappings are identified by their authored IDs, not by `profile:table.column`,
so one column may have several mappings and one concept may map to many
columns. Downstream renamed columns simply map to the same stable concept.
Callers must inspect status and handle multiple applicable mappings rather than
assuming equivalence.

Optional `qualifiers` are a closed scalar-valued map. They preserve descriptive
metadata such as `{"slot": 1}` without reserving parameters for one pathology
concept. Optional occurrence interpretations retain value/null meaning,
evidence status, claims, and caveats. Vocabulary selection remains
mapping-specific.

Evidence arrays use the release-neutral value `observed_source_values` when a
record depends on targeted observations of the applicable source artifact. The
record's profile scope, claim references, and cited source—not the controlled
evidence token—identify whether that artifact is Open V2, internal V2, internal
V1c, or another governed representation. The former
`observed_v2_values` value is not a schema-v8 input.

### Object mappings and co-location

Object bindings name an object, table, relevant columns, evidence, and optional
instance identity. Three optional independent axes replace the former mixed
representation enum:

- `completeness`: `complete`, `partial`, or `unknown`;
- `authority`: `preferred`, `reference`, `alternative`, or `unspecified`; and
- `derivation`: `source`, `projected`, `derived`, or `unknown`.

Co-location is never authored as a role. It is computed when multiple object
bindings select the same table. Physical relationships may also have the same
source and target table; this records within-row navigation and is not a
table-graph cycle.

Relationship bindings and ordered binding paths remain descriptive physical
routes. They are not executable joins and do not promote matching tuples into
clinical attribution guarantees.

## Extension modules

An extension has `extension_schema_version: 2`, identity, semantic version,
lifecycle, one target profile, explicit extension dependencies, all-family
contributions, evidence records, optional lineage, and a `profile_binding` with
the same physical shapes used by profiles. Empty physical collections are
valid for semantic-only extensions.

There is no revision array and no `reinterprets_concept`, `replaces_binding`,
or `coexists_with` mechanism. Extensions add scoped records and mappings with
new stable IDs. Competing or conditional interpretations remain simultaneously
addressable and are surfaced as alternatives or ambiguity.

## Composition and queries

Loading retains origin, module, lifecycle, target profile, and availability
for every contribution. Duplicate IDs, missing dependencies, dependency
cycles, invalid scope, unresolved references, duplicate mapping IDs, and
incompatible physical endpoints are errors. Independent extension input order
does not change the effective view.

Portable queries need no profile. Profile-dependent operations require an
explicit profile when applicable contributions, qualifications, vocabularies,
or mappings differ. Python, CLI, MCP, and the curator use the same resolver.

The Python entry point is:

```python
load_catalog(
    catalog_set=None,
    *,
    profile_paths=None,
    extension_paths=None,
    include_default_profiles=True,
    include_default_extensions=False,
)
```

CLI and MCP startup accept repeatable `--profile-file` and `--extension-file`.
`--no-default-profiles` omits manifest-selected profiles. Startup failures
identify the document and JSON path without exposing file content.

## Footer verification

`scripts/validate_source_profile.py` compares a selected profile's complete
table and column inventory to direct-child Parquet footer schemas. It checks
file/table presence, exact column names, physical types, and schema
nullability. It reads no rows, values, statistics, counts, identifiers, dates,
or report text.

Footer agreement does not validate key uniqueness, referential coverage,
cardinality, clinical attribution, ROI geometry, outcome capture, or
availability. The verifier is intentionally exact rather than a partial
catalog-authoring scanner.

It also reads Parquet only. The internal V1c image-metadata table is delimited
text with no embedded schema, so it is outside footer verification and remains a
separate authoring concern; the verifier must not be widened into a text reader.

## Authoring from local source data

Footer verification is not the only permitted authoring evidence. In an
authorized environment, maintainers may perform minimal, question-specific
inspection of local source data to reconcile represented values, sentinels,
row grain, or physical relationships. This investigation remains outside the
runtime catalog and verifier.

Historical references—including the V1 Open Data dictionary and public EMBED
documentation—and the V2 Open Data legend must be checked against internal V2
rather than copied as profile truth. The authored result may contain reconciled
non-identifying controlled values and supported meanings, but never raw rows,
identifiers, report text, extracts, empirical counts, frequencies, or
distributions.

Represent a targeted source-data observation as a profile source with kind
`supporting_internal` and locator kind `logical_artifact`. Its version scope and
notes should identify the internal-V2 question it answered without recording a
local path, row, or source value.

## Authoring rule

Search existing stable IDs before adding meaning. Reuse shared semantics when
meaning is unchanged, but put legitimately profile-specific objects and
concepts in that profile's contributions with correct availability. Keep
physical columns in table inventories and semantic interpretation in mappings.
Record uncertainty explicitly; do not manufacture physical details from a
semantic scaffold.
