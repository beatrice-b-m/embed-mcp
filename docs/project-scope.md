# Project scope and authoring requirements

## Purpose

This project maintains a concise clinical-semantic context backbone for agents
working with EMBED data. An unfamiliar agent should be able to begin with a
clinical question and determine:

- which clinical objects and observations are represented;
- what one instance of each object means;
- how a selected profile identifies a clinical instance, including identity
  scope and the absence of longitudinal identity;
- how objects relate, including cardinality, optionality, and attribution
  limitations;
- which features describe each object and what their codes and missing states
  mean;
- which event, documentation, and availability times are candidates for a
  timeline;
- how supplied or unsupported aggregation behaves across finding, side, exam,
  and patient levels;
- what evidence supports each assertion, at what profile scope, and which
  questions remain unresolved; and
- how a selected release binds those semantics to physical tables, columns,
  types, keys, joins, occurrence-specific interpretations, and composed paths.

The tool supplies trustworthy context for agents to design their own cohorts,
pipelines, and analyses. It does not prescribe those designs.

## Canonical deliverable

`catalog/semantic/catalog.json` is the source of truth for shared clinical
meaning. Profiles and extensions may add availability-scoped meaning alongside
their physical representation; `catalog/profiles/open-v2.json` owns the
released public representation and `catalog/profiles/internal-v2.json` is the
non-default working internal profile. Its binding inventories the wide
MagView clinical table. Procedure-level information is supported, while
specimen-level presence, completeness, reliability, identity, and cardinality
remain unresolved. Its image-metadata binding inventories the internal V1c
image-metadata table and binds image, co-located patient, exam, and
image-derived side, DICOM-attribute, modality, enrichment, and serialized
region-of-interest representations; the clinical surface is internal V2 while
the paired image metadata is the most recent internal V1c artifact, covers
every EMBEDv1 exam and patient, and is narrower than clinical V2.
The profile additionally inventories `HormoneHist_anon`, `ProcedureHist_anon`
(the `ProcHist` surface), and `CancerHist_anon` from reviewed topology packets
plus confirmation that each omitted only its free-text `comment` field. Packet
pandas types are parse observations, comment is assessed as text, and schema
nullability is conservatively nullable. Supported HormoneHist and ProcHist
semantics bind to these inventories without declaring unique history-entry
identity. Their accessions are recording context, not historical event time.
CancerHist has a confirmed self/relative subject flag and relationship-category
role; its draft cancer dictionaries remain provisional, and BRCA encodings,
relative identity, and timing remain unresolved. Observed constancy, key labels,
and code co-occurrence do not independently establish clinical ownership,
identity, or meaning. See [history packet review](history-topology-review.md).

`catalog/catalog-set.json` selects bundled defaults.
Together they must
remain:

- valid against their version-matched standalone JSON Schemas;
- directly usable without a database, index service, or generated Markdown;
- clinically normalized independently of physical storage;
- explicit about evidence, coverage, missing states, uncertainty, attribution,
  time meaning, aggregation, identity scope, and occurrence interpretation;
- discoverable from clinical language without table names or stable IDs;
- safe to bind to normalized tables, denormalized views, databases, or future
  releases without copying semantic definitions; and
- count-free and non-executable.

Markdown documents explain the format and decisions but are not parsed as
catalog data. Human-readable references must be derived from the structured
catalog rather than maintained as competing sources of truth. Synchronization
is a reviewed, manual authoring responsibility; no generated-document pipeline
currently exists.

## Clinical-semantic model

Portable semantics are primary. The initial breast-imaging model represents:

```text
patient
└── breast-imaging episode
    └── imaging exam
        ├── breast side
        ├── image
        │   └── region of interest (internal-v2 contribution; bound to the
        │       internal V1c image-metadata table as serialized per-image
        │       collections)
        └── imaging finding
            └── imaging interpretation / recommendation
                └── linked procedure
                    └── pathology observation
                        └── pathology diagnosis
```

Radiology report and risk-assessment objects provide additional documentation
and clinical context. This diagram is navigation, not a deterministic workflow:
relationships can be optional, branching, many-to-many, incompletely
attributed, or unsupported in a profile.

Clinical objects define meaning and instance grain. Concepts define reusable
features owned by those objects. Semantic relationships define clinical
adjacency and attribution independently of joins. Temporal semantics,
aggregations, guardrails, and coverage capture the qualifications an agent
needs before selecting an analysis policy.

Physical tables are not the conceptual model. `profile_binding` is a secondary
implementation layer containing:

- table-owned column inventories with type and schema nullability;
- many-to-many feature-to-column mappings;
- object-to-table mappings with independent completeness, authority, and
  derivation axes;
- optional descriptive table grains and key candidates; and
- physical relationship bindings, composed binding paths, and join hazards.

A clinical object does not need its own table. One row can represent parts of
several objects, and the same semantic model can bind to a different layout.
Co-location is inferred from shared table mappings rather than authored as a
representation role.

The shared semantic catalog includes images because they are part of EMBED,
including the public data. Internal-v2 inventories the complete
physical schema of `magview_all_cohorts_PACS_v2_anon` and binds each supported
clinical object independently despite their wide-row co-location. It also adds
profile-scoped specimen, staging, biomarker, nodal, and source-workflow
meaning, but specimen-level fields remain an unreliable, unresolved surface
that current internal operations should not depend on.

Internal-v2 also binds the internal V1c
image-metadata extraction, at one row per extracted DICOM image instance. It
binds the image object, co-located patient, exam, and image-derived breast-side
projections, and a cross-table accession route for the exam-to-image
relationship. Each ROI still has exactly one required source image; the ROI
physical representation is a serialized per-image collection with positionally
aligned count, coordinate, frame-index, and depth-derivation fields, so the
table is not one row per ROI and carries no ROI identifier. ROI coordinates use
inclusive `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]` bounds in the attached DICOM
pixel-array space. Curated coordinates are expected within the image bounds;
residual out-of-bounds coordinates may be safely clipped. Annotations originate
from radiologists during routine clinical care through multiple workflows,
including annotation DICOM objects without pixel arrays and ROI_SS/ROI_SSC
screen captures, and `ROI_depth_derived` marks model-inferred DBT frame depth.
For DBT images, `ImagesInAcquisition` represents the number of frames or
z-slices in the image, not the number of distinct image instances in an
acquisition group; when represented, it bounds zero-based ROI frame indices.
Stable per-region identity and cross-image ROI correspondence are not
represented. `acc_anon` remains one distinct exam
identifier across EMBED, uses the same namespace in both tables, and belongs to
exactly one `empi_anon`; a cross-patient association is an invalid data-quality
error and must not be retained as a valid link. The anonymized DICOM path is
intended for every extracted image; its basename is the anonymized SOP Instance UID
within one dataset version, and a missing value likely means anonymization
failed before the de-identified file could be saved. DICOM Burned In Annotation
retains the standard source-declaration meaning for sufficient identifying
annotation, including distinct `YES`, `NO`, and absent states. Because the
paired image metadata is internal V1c rather than V2, it covers the complete
EMBEDv1 exam and patient set and remains narrower than the clinical table: an
unmatched later clinical exam records missing extraction coverage,
never an exam without images.

## Breast-cancer outcome focus

The initial outcome representation must distinguish:

- invasive breast cancer;
- in-situ breast cancer;
- high-risk lesion;
- borderline lesion;
- benign finding;
- non-breast cancer; and
- unattached pathology.

The first six are represented diagnosis groups. `unattached_pathology` is a
missing or attachment state, not another diagnosis code. It does not establish
disease absence, benign pathology, adequate follow-up, or a negative outcome.

Pathology relationships must explain how observations and diagnoses can relate
to a patient, exam, breast side, imaging finding, and procedure. Finding-level
attribution can be optional or many-to-many. No foreign-key or deterministic
backfill guarantee may be inferred from a matching physical tuple.

Supplied Open V2 side- and exam-level pathology-severity rollups use the minimum
because the represented scale is inverse. Internal-v2 maps the actual
finding-associated severity occurrence produced by the extraction's fixed
mapping over `path1` through `path10`, selecting the most severe linked group,
but does not copy Open V2's curated
side- or exam-level aggregate columns and has no supplied patient-level
aggregate. Any downstream reduction must declare grouping, attribution,
multiplicity, and time; treat null severity with any populated descriptor and
internal code `6` as data-quality errors; and, when selecting the most severe among governed comparable
values, use the minimum. The catalog does not choose that operation as a
universal default.

Outcome coverage must state what is known and unknown about capture and
follow-up. Absence of a recorded outcome is not proof that the outcome did not
occur. A represented binary endpoint may validly encode “no represented event
under this extraction policy,” but it must not be described as “never biopsied”
or “cancer-free.” Restricting an estimand to pathology-observed records is not
inherently invalid; the conditioning and its limits on generalizability must be
named.

Longitudinal pathology candidate discovery operates at patient scope even when
the requested output grain is an exam side or finding. A candidate pathology
accession belongs to the candidate pathology-associated exam and must not be
forced equal to the index exam accession.

Risk outputs with unresolved scale, horizon, model-version, exceptional-value,
or probability semantics can remain useful for association or ranking. They
must not be treated as calibrated probabilities or used for calibration and
Brier-score interpretation until those semantics are validated.

## Temporal semantics

Candidate dates are documented by what they represent, not collapsed into a
single diagnosis date. Relevant distinctions include:

- imaging-exam event time;
- procedure event time;
- specimen-collection event time;
- pathology documentation or report time; and
- the time at which information becomes available to an analysis.

Open-v2 can explicitly mark a clinically meaningful candidate such as specimen
collection time as unsupported when no supported feature represents it. The
catalog must not invent a proxy or silently substitute procedure or report
time. Missingness remains missing for the selected semantic endpoint. A
different time may be studied only as a separately named endpoint or sensitivity
analysis, never as a silent fallback or coalesced replacement.

No candidate is a universal diagnosis date. Agents and users remain responsible
for choosing task-specific anchors, follow-up windows, outcomes, exclusions,
censoring, and temporal feature boundaries. Downstream procedure, pathology, or
report information can create temporal leakage when applied to an earlier
target.

## Reusable reasoning guardrails

Guardrails state interpretation constraints that recur across analyses. Initial
coverage should include:

- null or absent pathology is not a negative diagnosis;
- imaging assessment is not pathology truth;
- downstream clinical information may cause temporal leakage;
- finding-to-pathology attribution may be optional or many-to-many;
- movement among finding, side, exam, and patient grain needs an explicit
  aggregation policy;
- different clinical timestamps answer different questions; and
- physical co-location does not prove contemporaneous availability.

Guardrails may link to relevant objects, concepts, relationships, time,
aggregation, coverage, and evidence. They must not grow into named research
workflows or encode cases, controls, exclusions, follow-up windows, or
preferred estimands. A controlled category distinguishes `prohibition`,
`analyst_choice`, and `interpretation_limit`; priority (`critical`, `high`, or
`standard`) makes the most important applicable constraints prominent without
turning them into policy.

## Discovery requirements

`discover` is the clinical-first entry point. It searches shared semantics,
applicable profile/extension contributions, and supporting context claims
without requiring a caller to know a table name or stable identifier.

Every match must explain why it matched through:

- entity kind and stable ID;
- matched fields and terms;
- unmatched query terms; and
- deterministic score.

Discovery uses deterministic query intents for clinically important language,
including longitudinal search, temporal fallback, probability calibration,
identity, laterality, and represented endpoints. Applicable high-priority
guardrails and unresolved coverage may receive reserved result slots. Every
boost remains visible in match reasons, explicit kind filters remain binding,
and ordering is deterministic.

No-result diagnostics must distinguish:

- filters excluding otherwise matching entries;
- unknown controlled filter values;
- vocabulary mismatch;
- explicit unsupported profile coverage; and
- no indexed catalog coverage.

An empty result must never be presented as evidence that a clinical object,
state, relationship, or event is absent from EMBED. Exact semantic getters
support follow-up navigation and return resolved constraints; profile-binding
lookup is secondary.

## Portability and count-free policy

Do not record empirical dataset summaries in the portable catalog or
agent-facing feature documentation. Prohibited examples include:

- table or row totals;
- null, non-null, blank, duplicate, or distinct-value counts;
- value frequencies or proportions;
- quantiles, observed extrema, and prevalence estimates; and
- release-specific match or cardinality measurements presented as clinical
  semantics.

The policy does not prohibit semantic numbers. Documented code values, units,
time horizons, physical types, scalar mapping qualifiers such as a documented
repeated-field slot, qualitative cardinality, and genuinely defined sentinel
meanings belong when they explain representation.
Schema nullability is physical metadata; how often null occurs is not.

Unresolved missing-value or sentinel behavior may be stated without a
frequency. Prefer “null semantics are not documented” over a release
measurement.

## Normalization and authoring rules

### Objects and concepts

Create one clinical object for one stable entity or observation grain. Create
one concept for one stable feature meaning and attach it to every owning
object. Reuse the concept across profiles and physical projections when meaning
is unchanged.

Create separate concepts when meaning changes. A finding-level presence flag,
side-level rollup, and exam-level rollup are not interchangeable merely because
their column names share a stem.

Profiles and extensions may contribute new objects, concepts, relationships,
temporal semantics, aggregations, guardrails, and coverage. Give them portable
or profile availability explicitly when the module default is insufficient.
Do not create a shared placeholder merely to obtain permission to describe a
real profile-specific concept.

Technical concepts may have no clinical-object owner. They must remain
explicitly technical and must not be promoted to clinical identity, ordering,
or linkage across releases.

An object binding's optional `instance_identity` states identifying columns,
identity scope, reserved synthetic exceptions, physical rows per clinical
instance, and whether identity persists longitudinally. Row keys remain storage
metadata and must not be promoted to clinical identity.

### Missing states and vocabularies

Record field-specific missing states with their source representation, meaning,
evidence, and caveats. Do not apply catalog-wide null, delimiter, ordering,
repetition, or sentinel rules without evidence.

Reusable code dictionaries belong under `vocabularies`. Vocabulary completeness
and parsing behavior stay explicit. A released list is not automatically
exhaustive, and a composed string must not be split when delimiter semantics
are undocumented.

When the same portable concept has different value or null meaning at different
physical occurrences, record `occurrence_interpretations` on the feature
binding rather than applying one global meaning. Representation, meaning,
review status, claim references, and caveats remain occurrence-specific.

Declare every physical column once under its table. Feature mappings reference
that inventory and carry a stable mapping ID plus `direct`, `derived`,
`conditional`, `ambiguous`, or `unresolved` status. A column may remain
unmapped, one column may have several mappings, and one concept may map to many
columns. Optional `qualifiers` contain scalar descriptive metadata only.

### Relationships

Every semantic relationship records:

- source and target clinical objects;
- relationship kind;
- directional cardinality;
- endpoint optionality;
- attribution meaning and limitations;
- temporal qualification;
- claim references and caveats.

These are clinical-semantic claims, not join claims. A profile's physical
relationship binding separately records tables, column tuples, source
completeness, physical cardinality, evidence, and join hazards.

When one semantic relationship requires multiple physical hops, register an
ordered `relationship_binding_paths` entry. Every step must resolve within the
same profile and adjacent endpoints must be compatible. The path is descriptive
navigation, not an executable join.

### Time, aggregation, and coverage

Temporal records distinguish event, documentation, and availability meaning.
Aggregation records distinguish provided, analyst-defined, unsupported, and
unresolved transitions. Coverage records make supported, unsupported,
unresolved, and uncataloged topics discoverable at the correct scope.

Unsupported and unresolved are useful results. Do not replace them with a
preferred proxy, derivation, or analysis default.

### Guardrails

Add a guardrail only when it constrains interpretation across research
questions. Link it to the semantic entities and claims that justify it. Do not
encode task-specific recipes, cohort alternatives, SQL, predicates, or
scientific-validity judgments.

## Evidence and source priority

Use each source for the claim it can actually support:

- maintainer-confirmed facts are the strongest evidence for intended clinical
  meaning;
- the internal V2 schema and targeted observations of internal V2 source data
  establish its physical representation and represented values;
- the V2 Open Data legend is relevant comparison evidence for concepts retained
  across the internal and curated public representations;
- supporting internal material can explain provenance and known processing;
  and
- the V1 Open Data dictionary and
  [public EMBED documentation](https://docs.hitilab.com/datasets/embed) provide
  historical definitions and candidate value meanings.

Use the controlled evidence value `observed_source_values` for targeted
observations of a governed source artifact. It deliberately does not encode a
release name: the containing profile, claim references, and cited source carry
the V1c, V2, public, or internal version boundary. Do not use the former
`observed_v2_values` value for schema-v8 content.

The V1 dictionary and public documentation are non-comprehensive and primarily
describe earlier EMBED releases. They are not authoritative for internal V2 on
their own. Likewise, a value observed in internal V2 establishes occurrence,
not clinical meaning or exhaustiveness. Reconcile these sources: retain
consistent meanings, record release-specific differences, and leave conflicts
unresolved or contradicted rather than silently preferring one source.

Apply review state at claim level. Catalog membership does not itself make a
statement authoritative. Portable entities reference claims with
`context-id#claim-id`, preserving the exact assertion and scope. Conflicts and
unknowns remain traceable rather than being silently overwritten.

General clinical, EMBED-general, and profile-specific scopes remain distinct.
A profile-specific verified claim must cite evidence applicable to internal V2,
which may include a narrowly described source-data observation alongside the
reference used to interpret it. Cite source data as a non-sensitive logical
artifact; never reproduce a row or identifying value as provenance.
In a profile module, use `supporting_internal` with a `logical_artifact`
locator for such an observation, and state its profile and question scope in
`version_scope` and notes rather than exposing a local path or source values.

## Local source investigation

The ignored `reference_files/` directory contains local release artifacts used
to construct and verify profile bindings. When access is authorized, a
maintainer or agent may inspect source rows and values to answer a named,
bounded catalog question. Examples include enumerating the represented values
of an already identified categorical feature, checking whether a documented
sentinel occurs as described, or testing a proposed row-grain or relationship
interpretation.

Use the smallest practical projection and subset. Do not begin with broad
profiling, generate a general-purpose data report, or treat exploratory
statistics as catalog semantics. A targeted check may compute the information
needed to answer its question, but raw rows, identifiers, anonymized dates,
report text, extracts, empirical counts, frequencies, distributions, and
statistics must not be copied into tracked files, tests, documentation, commit
messages, or task reports. Reconciled non-identifying controlled values and
their documented meanings may enter profile vocabularies or occurrence
interpretations.

Local reference material may include internal V2 clinical tables, a
non-comprehensive V1 Open Data dictionary, and the V2 Open Data legend. Public
EMBED pages such as
[Dataset Structure](https://docs.hitilab.com/datasets/embed/structure) and
[Label Assignment](https://docs.hitilab.com/datasets/embed/label-assignment)
are additional historical context. Compare all of these against the internal
V2 source rather than assuming their field lists, values, aggregation products,
or physical layout were carried forward unchanged.

The directory is optional for a clone and must never be committed. Temporary
investigation code and outputs must remain ignored or outside the checkout, and
staged changes must be reviewed for accidental source content.

The dedicated source-profile verifier remains intentionally narrower: it reads
Parquet footer schemas only and does not perform semantic investigation. A
profile may bind an artifact it cannot read, such as the internal V1c
delimited-text image metadata, whose recorded physical types are assessed parse
types stated as such in the table caveats.

The incomplete alpha context system and Cortex knowledge-base notes are design
and hazard-discovery inputs, not runtime dependencies or unreviewed clinical
authorities. Recipes from those systems must not become executable V2 policy.
Canonical assertions still require portable sources at the applicable scope.

## Minimal tooling boundary

The catalog loader, strict validator, exact getters, binding queries, and
deterministic discovery use only the Python standard library. Embeddings,
vector databases, search services, SQLite FTS, and fuzzy-matching dependencies
remain outside the core.

The optional stdio MCP adapter calls the same core API as the CLI, writes
protocol messages only to stdout, and exposes read-only tools. The optional
local curation viewer is a separate companion distribution; its Python modules
and browser assets are not present in the base wheel.

Source distributions retain canonical resources under `catalog/`; built
wheels bundle the JSON and JSON Schema so the default loader and installed
commands do not depend on the checkout working directory. Draft 2020-12 JSON
Schema validates closed shapes and local conditions. The core validator
separately enforces graph, provenance, clinical, and profile invariants.
Schema v8 has no compatibility loader: semantic schema 7, profile or extension
schema 1, schema-v6 monoliths, and unknown versions are fatal startup errors.

## Non-goals

The project does not:

- encode SQL, dataframe operations, executable joins, or pipelines;
- select preferred cohort definitions, labels, anchors, windows, exclusions,
  censoring, or aggregation policies;
- claim that a cohort or analysis is scientifically valid;
- treat physical tables or denormalized rows as the clinical model;
- anticipate every research workflow;
- provide clinical advice;
- expose clinical rows, identifiers, report text, or local source extracts; or
- add empirical counts or distributions to the portable catalog.

## Profile binding requirements

A profile is complete when:

- its key exactly matches one declared profile;
- each feature mapping has a unique ID and references an available concept,
  declared table, and declared column;
- each nonempty object binding references an available object, declared table,
  and bound columns;
- table column inventories own physical type and schema nullability, while
  feature mappings do not duplicate them;
- unmapped physical columns are allowed and remain visibly unresolved;
- declared `instance_identity` is scoped and does not confuse physical rows
  with persistent clinical identity;
- occurrence interpretations qualify the physical binding whose value or null
  meaning they describe;
- every bound table has one table specification; optional grain is descriptive
  rather than selected from a global closed list;
- key candidates state kind, uniqueness, completeness, evidence, and caveats;
- physical relationship endpoints resolve to compatible bound columns;
- relationship bindings retain source completeness, bidirectional
  cardinality, evidence, caveats, join hazards, claim references, and relevant
  semantic links;
- composed relationship paths contain valid ordered steps with compatible
  adjacent tables; and
- unsupported capture or representation is recorded through coverage rather
  than inferred from missing columns.

Footer validation verifies the selected profile's exact physical table,
column, type, and schema-nullability surfaces only. It reads direct-child
Parquet footer metadata and no rows, values, counts, or statistics. It does not
establish uniqueness, referential coverage, cardinality, clinical attribution,
ROI geometry, outcome capture, or availability.

## Documentation synchronization

Any functional catalog, CLI, MCP, curator, packaging, or schema change must
update relevant usage, format, architecture, and configuration documentation
in the same logical commit. Examples and cross-references must be checked for
stale identifiers, commands, filters, fields, and file paths. The current
architectural decision is documented in
[`architecture-v8.md`](architecture-v8.md). Earlier architecture pages and the
schema-v7 profile-module migration are retained as history.

## Completion criteria

A clinical-semantic change is complete when it:

- passes strict schema and core cross-reference validation;
- defines clinical meaning and instance grain independently of storage;
- records adjacent-object relationships with cardinality, optionality,
  attribution limits, and temporal qualification;
- attaches concepts to correct objects and preserves code and missing-state
  meaning;
- distinguishes event, documentation, and availability time without selecting
  a universal diagnosis date;
- records provided, analyst-defined, unsupported, and unresolved aggregation
  transitions explicitly;
- uses reusable guardrails instead of task-specific workflows;
- records supported, unsupported, unresolved, and uncataloged coverage at the
  correct scope;
- preserves claim-level provenance and unresolved questions;
- keeps profile tables, columns, types, keys, and joins in the secondary
  binding layer;
- represents bounded clinical-instance identity, occurrence-specific meanings,
  and multi-edge physical paths explicitly;
- adds no executable policy or empirical dataset summary;
- supports clinical-first discovery with match explanations and diagnostic
  no-result states, deterministic intent boosts, and constraint-aware result
  composition;
- includes focused synthetic tests and checked-in integration assertions for
  changed behavior; and
- includes synchronized documentation and a focused Git commit.
